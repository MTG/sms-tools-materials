Sound analysis/synthesis tools for music applications written in python (with a bit of C). Available at https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools.

More information in https://www.python.org/. We will use python in all the exercises and in this first one you will start learning about it by performing some basic operations with sound files.\n","\n","__Jupyter notebooks:__ Jupiter notebooks are interactive documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. More information in https://jupyter.org/. It supports Python and all the exercises here use it.\n","\n","__Wav file:__ The wav file format is a lossless format to store sounds on a hard drive. Each audio sample is stored as a 16 bit integer number (sometimes also as 24 bit integer or 32 bit float). In this course we will work with only one type of audio files. All the sound files we use in the assignments should be wav files that are mono (one channel), in which the samples are stored in 16 bits, and that use (most of the time) the sampling rate of 44100 Hz. Once read into python, the samples will be converted to floating point values with a range from -1 to 1, resulting in a one-dimensional array of floating point values."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fDPPkGCD4pYQ"},"source":["## Part 1 - Reading in an audio file\n","Write a function that reads an audio file and returns 10 consecutive samples of the file starting from\n","the 50001th sample.
